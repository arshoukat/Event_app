# Logo Setup Instructions

## How to Add Your Logo

1. Place your logo image file in this directory (`assets/`) and name it `logo.png`
2. Recommended logo specifications:
   - Format: PNG (with transparency) or SVG
   - Size: At least 512x512 pixels for best quality
   - Aspect ratio: Square (1:1) works best
   - Background: Transparent preferred

3. The logo will automatically appear in:
   - Login page
   - Signup page
   - Header (main navigation)

## Current Status
